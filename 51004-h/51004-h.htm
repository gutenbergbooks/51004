    <h2>Introductory</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap-simple"><span class="upper-case">My Monks of Vagabondia</span> comprises
Fact-stories selected from the old files of
the Self Master Magazine. I wish to present the
defeated man, as he really is, to the reader who
cannot fail to appreciate the humor and tragedy
that makes up his wayward life. The bond of
sympathy should be awakened between us and
the so-called prodigal.</p>

<p>A wider publicity should be given to the unique
but practical uplift work that I have founded and
carried on for the past five years among these
weaker brothers.</p>

<p>The stories explain in part the methods and
plans of the Family of Self Masters.</p>

<p>It is&mdash;we believe&mdash;the only book in which
a writer has received his facts for his stories
direct from a life-experience with outcast men.</p>

<p>Not alone that, but the volume is printed, bound
and illustrated by the unexpected guests&mdash;the
Itinerant Monks of whom the tales are told, and
who make their home in our so-called Monastery.</p>

<p>The day approaches when broken men shall
have beautiful, though simple, homes of their own
making, modeled after the group idea of The Self
Master Colony. They will be established outside of
the different cities of the world, and opened hospitably
to all men who come in their hour of need
or weakness, seeking Self Mastery and the peace
that accompanies it.</p>

<p>The proceeds from the sale of these stories go
toward the purchase and installation of much
needed equipment for the Printshop and Bindery.
With this equipment the men can work out their
own independence, industrially and socially.</p>

<p>When a man has lived months and years enslaved
by some vicious habit&mdash;self-destructive
and careless of consequences&mdash;his sub-conscious
mind is a sensitive matrix on which the sordid
history is deeply engraved. The certain change
can come only as the man learns values and
respects them by a right life.</p>

<p>The sub-conscious self takes on a complete reformation
slowly. An evil habit does not gain mastery
over the man upon the instant nor once in control
is its grip broken by any feeble affirmation
or miraculous phenomenon.</p>

<p>The hope comes when one turns one&rsquo;s thought
from the destructive to the constructive, and lives
in the sight of the new born faith until wisdom
lifts the darkened veil and freedom follows as its
rightful legacy.</p>

<p>The Self Master Colony offers an open door to
the disheartened man during the period of his
awakening to his real strength and helps him
with its constant care and sympathy back to his
true self.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> man had walked the
entire distance from New
York to the Self Master
Family. In truth, he had
walked more than the entire
distance, for once or
twice he had lost his way&mdash;as
many a man has done
in other walks of Life.
Painfully he had retraced his steps to the right
road. The mistakes had told heavily upon his failing
strength. They had made him just that much
more weary with it all. No doubt mistakes are
wonderfully educational; they make men wiser,
and therefore better, for in the final analysis wisdom
and goodness are synonymous.</p>

<p>He complained bitterly at the hardness of his
lot and found little comfort in the thought that he
might reach the Colony too late for the evening
meal.</p>

<p>His friend who had met him walking aimlessly
up and down Broadway assured him that there
was always a coffee pot boiling on the old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
cook stove in the boys&rsquo; kitchen&mdash;that the Colony
House never locked its doors.</p>

<p>To a man who feels that every door in the
world is locked against him there is comfort in
the thought that there is really one place where he
may find a welcome. His friend had said that
there would be no questions asked him on his
arrival&mdash;no investigation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No investigation,&rdquo; he muttered aloud, &ldquo;thank
God! It is easier for a camel to pass through the
eye of a needle than it is for a &lsquo;down-and-out&rsquo;
man to convince Professional Charity that he is
really hungry. I think they would have given me
a &lsquo;hand-out&rsquo; when they investigated me the last
time if I could have told them what town my
mother was born in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled with weak cynicism at the folly of
his thoughts, and then became suddenly serious,
for on the side hill in front of a large colonial
house, worked out in white stone, were the words
&ldquo;The Self Masters.&rdquo; He stopped and studied the
quiet, home-like scene from the road. All these
weary miles he had come to ask food and shelter,
and now his courage seemed to fail him. He sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
down by the road side and leisurely took his pipe
from his pocket. Then he prepared tobacco with
the utmost care, filled the pipe and lighted it.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;THE SELF MASTERS&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>he spelled out the letters on the sign; &ldquo;What the
h&mdash;ll is that?&mdash;Self Master&mdash;Self Mastery&mdash;Self
Control. Old Man, if you had ever had any
of that Self Control in your make-up you would
not be a Knight of the Dusty Road!... You
had better go back to the East Side where you
know the land; where no man cares whether you
live decently or not&mdash;if you can buy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the sound of a piano and male voices
came to him and awakened him to a new train of
thought. &ldquo;It is a Monastery&mdash;a Monastery of
Vagabondia,&rdquo; he said, "and why not? why shouldn&rsquo;t
a man, even a homeless man, have his Monastery,
if you please, where he can forget his past and
live cleanly? If he only lives cleanly for a day
and falls.... It&rsquo;s something to remember&mdash;a
day he doesn&rsquo;t have to be ashamed of. Who
knows but that in the one day of unselfish living
a man is more truly his real self than he is in all
the other days of his vicious years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Throughout his long life Moses was the leader
of his people, but it was in that day that he talked
with God&mdash;face to face&mdash;that his countenance
did shine like the sun. It was not when he slew
the Egyptian, and, frightened, buried him in the
sand; it was when he stood in the presence of
Divinity&mdash;that Moses was Moses. When the
drunkard is in his sober mind, when the liar is
speaking the truth, when the thief is giving honest
measure, when the murderer is kind to his fellow,
then, and only then, is the true Self finding expression.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew heavily at his pipe and then smilingly
said, &ldquo;My pipe has gone out!&rdquo; He knocked out
the ashes into his hand and scattered them to the
wind, gravely, as if it were some religious ceremony.
Then he dusted his shoes and clothes,
and straightening himself up to his full height, he
marched bravely up to the front door of the
house....</p>

<p>... A black crow, belated in his home-going,
left his corn-thieving, and, rising, flew across the
sky to his eyrie in the pines.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Resolved</span>, that old fashioned cow&rsquo;s milk is better
for Our Baby, than any
prepared food."</p>

<p>The debate on the above
subject will start at seven
o&rsquo;clock next Thursday evening.
The Conservatives of
our Colony will speak in
favor of cow&rsquo;s milk as a baby&rsquo;s food. The Progressives
will speak in favor of prepared food.</p>

<p>The parliamentary rules governing the debate
will be the same as govern a &ldquo;catch-as-catch-can&rdquo;
wrestling match.</p>

<p>No slugging will be permitted until forensic
effort has proven ineffective. When further argument
has become useless, the three-ounce boxing
gloves, recently donated to us, may be used to
force a decision. In fact, several of the boys who
talk but little, are practising with the gloves, so
that they may become factors in the final settlement
of the problem.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the literary coterie is in deep
study. One boy is reading up reference books on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the subject whenever he can find the time. Still
another blindfolds himself and opens the Bible at
random, looking for spiritual guidance on the subject
of infant diet. Of course the Court of Final
Appeal will be Her Ladyship&mdash;The Baby Herself.</p>

<p>She already knows a great deal about crackers
and breakfast foods, and she is far too clever not
to have her own opinion on the dietary properties
of milk and its substitutes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now it may be in point to tell how we came
to have a ten-months-old baby at our Colony.</p>

<p>We are ostensibly a young men&rsquo;s colony&mdash;men
and boys trying to get to their feet and become
independent and self-supporting. But if anyone
comes to us hungry, we like to give them something
more edible than a card to a professional
charity.</p>

<p>Had Hunger delayed her coming another week,
Our Baby and her mother might have been driven
to ask food and shelter on Christmas Eve. As it
was, they came to us on December 19th, at ten
o&rsquo;clock in the evening. They had no place in
which to sleep except the local police station, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
that is not the place for a little baby&mdash;even strong
men weaken in the chill of its hospitality.</p>

<p>So, on their arrival, the boys who were retiring
for the night, held a conference. Our supply of
beds and bedding did not even equal the demand
made upon it by the boys themselves. But that
did not cause them to hesitate, and all agreed that
they must not turn the newcomers away. One
boy immediately gave up his blanket, the second
his comforter, the third his bed. In that way the
mother and baby were made comfortable for the
night, little realizing that they were taking anything
away from those who had nothing to spare.
But homeless men are quickly sympathetic, for
what they know of hunger and cold is not altogether
hearsay.</p>

<p>On the next day we undertook to make more
permanent provision for the Baby and Mary, her
mother. We began to look around for beds. We
asked two of the kind-hearted clergymen if they
could obtain a bed for our new arrivals. One of
them phoned me later in the day to ask me what
town the poor people were from, and when I informed
him, he said "The woman should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
applied to the charity association of the city from
which they came. If the case was worthy, aid
would be given."</p>

<p>Worthy or unworthy, we didn&rsquo;t feel like sending
the Baby away. She was teething and fretful,
and a teething, fretful baby may not be as worthy
as one who grins and bears it.</p>

<p>The other minister said, &ldquo;The wonderful work
the Church was doing, had not so much to do
with the poor in this life, as in the hereafter.&rdquo;
Now in truth, while the mother was discouraged
and didn&rsquo;t care anything about life as far as she
herself was concerned, she had ambition for her
child, so she could not qualify and ask assistance
under these conditions.</p>

<p>The boys themselves made two wooden beds,
and fitted up a room for the Baby, while the mother
in turn helped the young men in the kitchen.</p>

<p>The Baby has grown strong and well. She likes
her big brothers with all their noise and horseplay,
and they like their Baby. To see rough homeless
men sing lullabies to an infant-in-arms, congratulating
themselves when she falls asleep
soothed by the monotonous humming of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
cradle song that they themselves thought they had
forgotten long ago, might renew one&rsquo;s faith in the
kindly humanity that lives in every heart.</p>

<p>Has not Christ said, &ldquo;And whosoever shall receive
one such little child in my name, receiveth
me.&rdquo;</p>


<p>THE BABY&rsquo;S FATHER</p>

<p>Now, this Baby has a father. He has lived in
Russia and came to America to earn money. One
of his older brothers was already located in New
York State, and from his letters sent over the sea,
it was plain that the opportunities for wealth in
the States were most promising.</p>

<p>The older brother had grown rich&mdash;very rich&mdash;working
on the railroad. He never earned less
than nine dollars a week, and now that he spoke
English, he earned twelve.</p>

<p>Such stories of easily acquired wealth lured
John, as we call him, to leave his Fatherland with
his wife and child. But unfortunately for John
and his family, they reached America during the
recent panic. Thousands of workmen were idle.
In New York, John could find no work. Even the
rich brother only worked part of the time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
having wife and children of his own, had nothing
to divide with John and his family. So John
drifted away seeking employment.</p>

<p>The few dollars that he brought with him became
exhausted, and although he studied English
evenings, he spoke it brokenly. One of the boys
at the Colony said he talked in &ldquo;kindlewood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While he was seeking employment, no word
came to the wife and child. Some said John would
never come back. But Mary believed in him. She
said that he had always loved the baby and he
knew that she herself could work. But at times
even she doubted when weeks followed weeks
and no word came.</p>

<p>Once when one of the boys was going to New
York, she called him aside quietly, and said, &ldquo;You
will see John in New York, I think.... Big man,
light hair ... tell him come home, see Baby....
I want him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But John was not seen in New York.</p>

<p>It was not until a few days ago that he returned.
He had traveled through New York State and on
to Massachusetts. No work&mdash;everywhere no
work! Sometimes he had walked. Sometimes he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
had jumped a freight. All to no purpose. He had
wanted to write good news to Mary, and he had
no good news to write. Always bad news. He
was a failure. He had wished he might end it all,
but the thought of the Baby had made him continue
the search for employment.</p>

<p>Finally, one day, a rich man in Montclair needed
a gardener. This man was rich&mdash;not rich like his
brother&mdash;but had houses and acres of splendid
farm. He would pay two dollars a day wages to
a man willing to work. It seemed too good to believe.
He would hurry back to his Baby and Mary.
They must know the good news.</p>

<p>So he came and told Mary he had a job, and a
little home for her and the Baby. They would be
rich like his brother.</p>

<p>So Mary went with John and they took their
Baby, all tied up in shawls.</p>

<p>That was yesterday&mdash;Monday&mdash;so there will
be no argument Thursday on &ldquo;Whether or not
old-fashioned cow&rsquo;s milk is better for babies than
prepared foods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Because we homeless men have lost Our Baby.</p>

<p>One of the boys asked the Chairman&mdash;another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
boy&mdash;if they would have the Debate, now that
the Baby was gone?</p>

<p>&ldquo;To hell with it,&rdquo; replied the Presiding Officer.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">&ldquo;My</span> razor went yesterday
for a beef stew,&rdquo; the
young dare-devil told me.
&ldquo;Not that I am one of
those collar-and-necktie-rounders,&rdquo;
he continued,
"who seek to give out the
impression that they are
gentlemen in distress, telling
you of their Southern family and a squandered
fortune when, in fact, they have never been
further South than Coney Island.... But when
a fellow decides to sell his razor he is about to
commit an act that severs the jugular vein of his
respectability.</p>

<p>"He may have, only the moment before, shaven
and groomed himself with the utmost care, still
he is nearly ready to join the ranks of the down-and-outs.
A man may sell his other belongings&mdash;his
clothes included&mdash;and yet preserve a
suggestion at least of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang-froid</i>. But when
the razor goes&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he can get a free shave at the Barbers&rsquo;
School,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That only helps for a day or two,&rdquo; he went
on. &ldquo;Better throw up your hands at once and
have it over. What man half ill with worry
cares to listen to some ambitious pupil say,
&lsquo;Teacher, shall I shave the right side of his face
up, or shave it down?&rsquo;&mdash;and, &lsquo;Teacher, how do
you shave the upper lip without cutting it?&rsquo; and,
&lsquo;Teacher, if I do cut it, shall I disinfect it with
carbolic or peroxide before I put on the new
skin?&rsquo;&mdash;No Barbers&rsquo; School for me. It is better
to turn philosopher on the instant&mdash;the old
philosophers and prophets grew long beards....
Talk about getting next to Nature in about
three days after a man has sold his razor, Nature
will get next to him, and if he is not as beardless
as an American Indian, he will be convinced
when he sees himself in a mirror, of the truth of
the Darwinian theory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Russia,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the beard is the patriarch&rsquo;s
badge of sanctity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it is in Jersey and several other States,&rdquo;
he replied. "Many a so-called hobo with two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
weeks&rsquo; growth of beard on his face may be at
heart only a conscientious respecter of the law&mdash;for
it is a misdemeanor in New Jersey to carry a
razor. It is legally declared to be a concealed
weapon. Many a poor rascal against whom a
charge of vagrancy could not be maintained has
found it so much the worse for him, and has been
forced to go to prison for carrying concealed
weapons in the form of a razor. So you see in
Jersey, as well as in Russia, a beard may be only
proof of honor.... The cleanly shaven man who
knocks at your side door and wins the unsuspecting
wife&rsquo;s confidence with that time-worn platitude
of Vagabondia, &lsquo;Lady, all I want is work,&rsquo;
may have a weapon concealed upon his person,
while the unshaven wanderer, the sight of whom
makes the women folks bolt doors, may be a
homeless fellow who really wants work, and
would rather be unkempt in appearance than
chance a prison-term for carrying a razor."</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have sold your razor?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not because I am trying to compete with
your Russian patriarch in sanctity. I sold it because
I&rsquo;m desperate.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you were not afraid of the misdemeanor
charge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He replied with a laugh that I did not like, and
I felt quickly to see if my watch was still in my
possession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your watch,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it
isn&rsquo;t the fear of doing time that holds me back.
I know what my friend wrote about me. I have
made up my mind to play square. You may not
believe it. You have heard too many mission
testimonies to believe much in them. But if I
live right&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t because my heart is softened,
my heart is cold and hard as a paving block.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friend wrote that you weren&rsquo;t such a
bad fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>"Don&rsquo;t believe him. In Elmira they have a
scheme of percentage, and if a man gets above a
certain percent he can win his freedom. In the
four years I was there I was safely within the
required percentage&mdash;all I had to do was to continue
my good behavior. I was within a few days
of freedom. Did you ever sense hatred&mdash;pure
hatred? Shylock felt it when he refused to accept
money to cancel Antonio&rsquo;s bond; when he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
not listen to threats or entreaties, but only muttered,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have my pound of carrion flesh.&rsquo; I
know what he felt. In the night, after weeks and
weeks of patient study and labor&mdash;after months
of good conduct, when I played their game and
won the chance of freedom. In the night, without
reason, I jumped from my bed and battered
at the bars and yelled and cursed at them all,
until they put me in the dungeon and took from
me my high percent. I lost a year that time."</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do the prison bars still hold you,&rdquo; I asked
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You act like a mad man when you talk of the
past. Some men can never throw off the thought
of their imprisonment. It rules their life. They
think only of prison and the crimes that follow
such thinking. There is no hope for them. Can&rsquo;t
you see it is your ideals that enslave or make you
free? Can&rsquo;t you see you are free?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty hard,&rdquo; he said, "but I want to
forget. My friend sent me to you. He said you
knew the path to freedom, and would help me.
Days and days I have waited for you to come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
me. My father would not have me at home, my
friends left me, my money grew less and less&mdash;my
clothes went, my razor&mdash;everything. And
still you did not come. Sometimes I&rsquo;d meet a
boy that told me of your work. Sometimes I
would doubt all I had heard, and then I would
become indifferent&mdash;mutter a prayer or plan a
crime. At last the letter came. I knew I was
being put to the test, and I sought to be firm.
Oh, God, such a test! What is it holds a man?
I was hungry, yet I knew how to steal; I needed
money, and I knew where I could rob with reasonable
safety. What is it holds a man like me?
At times I have thought it was my belief in you."</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean our Colony held out a hope to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid to take you into my Family,&rdquo; I
told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For fear I&rsquo;ll steal from you?&rdquo; he said, coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not that; I fear you cannot leave your
prison thoughts behind you when you enter the
Colony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you help me,&rdquo; he said, thoughtfully, &ldquo;I
think I can begin anew.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you promise never to speak to me or
anyone of your past life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not speak of it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you may go to the entrance gate with
me, and there I will decide if I can take you in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We talked on the way to the farm about many
things&mdash;for he had read and traveled much. We
made no mention of the Family or its work, but
as we came near the Colony House I stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;did they teach you a trade
at Elmira?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a metal roofer by trade,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you learn the trade in prison?&rdquo; I asked
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you mistake me for some other man,&rdquo;
he replied, quietly. &ldquo;I know nothing about prison
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, not only your friend told
me that you had served a term, but you told me
yourself?&rdquo; I said, severely.</p>

<p>He looked calmly into my face, but there were
tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I could not have told you, for had I told you
such a foolish falsehood I would have remem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>bered
it. Let us talk of something else."</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; I said, pleasantly. He was trying
to forget the past.</p>

<p>At that moment there came to us the vigorous
clamor of an old cow bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the bell that calls the boys to their evening
meal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, let us hurry, so we may be served at
the first table, for you are hungry.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="ph4">II</p>

<p>The holy Vedas teach us that as we pass from
life to life, Time places gentle fingers over the
eyes of memory, lest we become disheartened by
past errors and falter enslaved by the fears of
what we have been. Like the child who, having
worked out a problem on his slate, erases it all,
keeping only the answer, so we have within our
soul-life the result of our past experiences; all the
rest is erased.</p>

<p>Who cares about the detailed account of all the
happenings along the path we have traveled?
We know intuitively that much of the past must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
be condemned, but that which concerns us vitally
is the life we aim to live to-day.</p>

<p>Night closes on the sorrows of yesterday. Dawn
is radiant with the promise of a better day.</p>

<p>Our friend, &ldquo;Slippery Jim,&rdquo; tried to believe all
this, and to look with hope towards the future,
but he kept much to himself. He would take
long walks into the woods.</p>

<p>It disturbed me to see him so slow to take the
boys into his confidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never see you reading with the other men
in the evening,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;Men who love solitude
are either very good or very bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try to do better,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but for so
many years I have been used to being by myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still one has to live in the world&mdash;and our
world here is rather small,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Cheerfulness
is a duty one owes to his own soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And to others,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and to others,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>"I am inclined to view lightly my duty to others.
I owed a debt&mdash;a great debt once&mdash;to others,
and I have paid it. They measured it out of my
life, the payment they demanded. I have paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
it&mdash;paid it in tears and wretchedness&mdash;paid it
out of my heart and soul. Now I prefer to live
apart.... The Indians, so the poet says, when
on the march, leave their old and sick alone to
die. I am a sick savage, and as such, I ask my
rights."</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you believe in the Great Spirit and the
Happy Hunting Grounds?&rdquo; I asked gently, for I
knew he had no Indian blood in his veins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their religion is as good as many another,
and quite as poetical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then go into the forest and pray to your Great
Spirit,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Only don&rsquo;t discredit him by
being inconsiderate of others who would be kind
to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I not do my work?&rdquo; he asked, with rising
anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are expected to do your work, but I am
not speaking to you on that subject. I want to
know what you are thinking about while you are
at work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, that is my own affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, it is my affair also. You came
out here to have me help you. I want to help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You have helped me; you took me into this
Colony when my father had closed the door on
me; you have given me food&mdash;such as it is&mdash;and
out of the clothes sent in you have given me this
second-hand suit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you have worked like the other men and
paid by your labor for what you received?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that is all there is to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very, very little I have done for you,&rdquo;
and I started to leave him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment&rdquo;&mdash;he stopped me. &ldquo;I did
not intend to be unkind to you. You have treated
me much better than I have deserved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is something to have even simple food when
one is hungry,&rdquo; I said, severely. &ldquo;You have also
more courage than when you came. In your work
you know courage is quite important. You will
soon be able to go back to your old life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not that,&rdquo; his voice becoming less hardened.
"In these days I have lived with you and
observed the happiness you get out of your
work&mdash;in spite of its sacrefice&mdash;and compared it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
with my own way of living, I can not understand
how I could have ignored the good there&rsquo;s in me.
But, really, you should not expect us all to be as
cheerful as you are. You may see clearly the
Truth that we see only through a glass darkly."</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you plan to live like an honest man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I have not really lost after all,&rdquo; I said,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; he questioned, not having
heard clearly my remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said that if you have determined to live honestly,
that is something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That evening I saw him walking up and down
the kitchen floor with our Baby in his arms&mdash;for
that Winter we had a homeless mother and Baby
at the Colony. The Baby was kicking and laughing
as he carried her with measured stride around
the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I simply must put her to sleep,&rdquo; he said, confidingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sing to her,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am hazy on my slumber songs,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>A little later the Baby was nodding with half
closed eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she look pretty,&rdquo; said the admiring
mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She looks like Jeffries at the end of the fifth,&rdquo;
was Jim&rsquo;s reply.</p>

<p>A few moments later I heard him as he walked,
singing music of his own improvising to the words
of Wilde&rsquo;s prison poem:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"With slouch and swing around the ring,</div>
    <div class="verse">We trod the Fools&rsquo; Parade!</div>
    <div class="verse">We did not care; we knew we were</div>
    <div class="verse">The Devil&rsquo;s Own Brigade;</div>
    <div class="verse">And shaven head and feet of lead</div>
    <div class="verse">Make a merry masquerade."</div>
</div></div></div>


<p class="ph4">III</p>

<p>The Winter was nearly over when &ldquo;Slippery
Jim&rdquo; came to me and expressed a wish to return
to the World again. If his father would only
accept him once more!</p>

<p>My observation of a father&rsquo;s attitude towards
his prodigal son is that the moment the son desires
to live as he ought, not only do closed doors open,
but the father stands ready with outstretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
arms to receive him. This supposedly harsh
father, when he was convinced that his Jim
had worked faithfully at the Colony for several
months, was anxious that his son return home.
Even the boy&rsquo;s old employer expressed sympathy
and offered a position to him.</p>

<p>When this good news came I did not have to
tell the boy anything about its being one&rsquo;s duty
to be cheerful. He wanted to dance a clog on
the table in the men&rsquo;s reading room.</p>

<p>Early the next morning he left us, not waiting
to thank us, which was quite unnecessary; nor
hardly stopping to say good-bye to us. But a
few days afterward he wrote to me, saying that
after four years he was back with his father and
mother, brother and sisters, in his own room,
sleeping in his own bed. The family had arranged
it just the same as it had been before he left them
for those sad years in prison. His father had purchased
him a new suit for Easter. The next day
he was to start to work.</p>

<p>Nearly a year later he visited me. His work
had taken him out of town. "When I first met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
you," he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have a home. Now it is
a question which one to visit first, but I thought
I would come out to see you, and then go this
evening and see my other father.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">He</span> said that he came from
Germany, but he didn&rsquo;t
look it, for Germany is a
beautiful country, and he
was far removed from
even a suggestion of
beauty. Had he said he
had just arrived from &ldquo;No
Man&rsquo;s Land,&rdquo; it would
have been easily accredited. For a German, even
his accent and grammatical construction were
unsatisfactory. He did not begin his sentences
in the middle and talk both ways at once, after
the well established custom of Americanized
Teutons. In the stress of his excitement he
expressed himself concisely and clearly.</p>

<p>He was seated in the Charity House awaiting
the investigation of the social workers. He held
his head in his hands, while his body convulsed
frequently, and tears were in his eyes.</p>

<p>To see a man with unkempt whiskers indulging
in a crying spell like a delicate woman, is
almost as humorous as it is pathetic, unless one
knows what the man is crying about. Then, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the Germans, unlike the Irish, take their trouble
seriously, so that their despair often creates for
them the hell they fear.</p>

<p>Surely it wasn&rsquo;t a German who in the old Bible
days sent hired mourners to go about the street;
it was undoubtedly an Irishman whose genius
conceived the idea of paying other men to do his
weeping for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; I asked the German.</p>

<p>He surveyed me suspiciously from head to
foot, then replied politely enough: &ldquo;I am of German
parentage and have lived the greater part of
my life in Heidelberg, where my father and grandfather
were instructors in the University.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you arrive in America?&rdquo; I asked
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few days ago,&rdquo; he answered. "I came from
Paris, where I met with heavy&mdash;heavy for me&mdash;financial
reverses. I attempted to conduct a business
similar to your brokers, who loan money on
personal property, but being unfamiliar with
French law, I found I could not legally enforce
payments of the loans I made to the Frenchmen.
My entire life savings&mdash;small, it is true&mdash;were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
lost. In disgust I came to America, and my condition
now is worse than ever. I am desperate."</p>

<p>He did not raise his voice, speaking quietly, but
his hands were nervous, and his eyes reminded
me of Svengali&mdash;fascinating, but dangerous. My
impression was that I had seen safer men locked
in darkened cells and allowed only wooden spoons
with which to eat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has the charity association decided to help
you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear not,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;They wish me to
tell them my father&rsquo;s address in Germany, as
they inform me that they always make thorough
investigations. Several times they asked me my
home address, but I turned them from the point,
as I have no intention of adding my burdens to
the burdens my father and mother already have....
Does it seem quite generous of your social
workers to be so insistent?... But, pardon
me, have you not a saying that &lsquo;Beggars must
not be choosers?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not reply to his question, as I was thinking
what my Reception Committee&mdash;made up of
the boys of the Colony&mdash;would say to me if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
invited this much-bewhiskered individual to join
our Family. For the instant I forgot the German&rsquo;s
troubles in the thought of the troubles
which I was about to take upon myself. I smiled
at my approaching embarrassment. &ldquo;It is all
very well,&rdquo; the boys had cautioned me, &ldquo;to hold
us responsible for the newly-arrived members,
to make certain that no criminal nor fraud obtains
admission to the Family, but you might be a
little more discriminating in your selections, could
you not?&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The German was quick to avail himself of my
offer to join the Colony; he would go to Hoboken
and get his luggage and join me as soon as possible.
His luggage&mdash;he met me an hour later&mdash;consisted
of a wooden box too small to be called
a trunk, too large to be called a valise.</p>

<p>As we approached the Colony House we passed
several of the boys who had evidently seen us at
a distance, for they appeared deeply interested
in the setting sun, their faces turned from us.
Finally one fellow who, like a good Pullman porter,
can laugh at you without changing his facial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
expression, only if you watch closely you may
note that the muscles at the back of the neck
dance in uncontrolled merriment&mdash;came forward
and said to us: &ldquo;A beautiful sunset.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He should have been reprimanded for his impudence,
but I simply asked, &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the west,&rdquo; he explained. Then the boys
turned and laughed without restraint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An ordinary sunset and a most ordinary joke,&rdquo;
I said, rather icily. But they continued to laugh,
first looking at my companion and then at me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so ordinary,&rdquo; said another boy. &ldquo;If you
could see it from where we are you could understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand you only too well,&rdquo; I answered.</p>

<p>Then the two boys who were on the Reception
Committee came over to us and took my
German friend in hand. There were no more
remarks until we reached the house and the man
himself was quite out of hearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you bring out a man like that?&rdquo; the
cook questioned me soon after I reached the
house, and every one looked up from the even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>ing
paper he was reading anxious to have his
little laugh.</p>

<p>But years have taught me somewhat of the
ways of men. Did not Moses, when the children
of Israel attempted to entangle him in argument,
make his contention invulnerable by stating,
&ldquo;God spake unto Moses, saying,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that there wasn&rsquo;t much chance for argument.
The best thing they could do at such a
time was to quietly line up in the ranks. And
there is an answer that will always check the
hilarity of homeless men and make them as sympathetic
as children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you bring him out with you?&rdquo; the
cook repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I said, simply, &ldquo;the man is hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Each boy frowned at the cook and turned back
to his reading. And the cook made no answer,
except he served the new-comer with double
portions.</p>

<p>That night the German slept with his bed
between the two beds of the Reception Committee,
and I heard nothing from him until they came
to report to me in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said one of the committee, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
like that old party you brought out with you
yesterday. All night long in his sleep he was
muttering: &lsquo;Down with the millionaire; curse the
capitalist&rsquo;&mdash;that man is an anarchist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment later the second member of the committee
came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Floyd, you know that wooden box that
&lsquo;Whiskers&rsquo; brought with him?&rdquo; he asked, nervously;
&ldquo;I put my ear down to it and listened.
I could hear something inside going tick, tick,
tick, as plain as day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are excited,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;After breakfast send
the man to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In my room the German and myself talked a
long time.</p>

<p>I asked him about the University of Heidelberg,
the influence of the student in German politics and
of the world-wide socialistic movement&mdash;had
he ever read the works of Karl Marx, the great
Socialist?</p>

<p>No, he never had.</p>

<p>Had he ever read La Salle, the anarchist?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Or, in his travels, had he ever seen that little
pamphlet entitled, &ldquo;Dynamite as a Revolutionary
Agency?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>But despite the denial, it was plain to see that
my old German was the anarchist that my committee
had decided him to be. So I sent out
word that the boys should redouble their kindness
to their half-crazed friend. It was an
opportunity to try our simple methods upon a
man who felt that the sad old world and its
many peoples were as utterly lost as a man may
become who believes that there is no good within
himself. Men who feel themselves to be evil, they
work evil.</p>

<p>Hardly had a fortnight passed before our good
anarchist caught the spirit of the place and began
to feel that kindly sympathy that dwells even in
the hearts of stranded men. The young men
grew really fond of him.</p>

<p>At night he was the last man to knock at my
door to see that everything had been given attention;
in the morning he was the first to ask what
I wished done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a cheery &ldquo;good night&rdquo; and a cheery
&ldquo;good morning.&rdquo; After several months our anarchist
succeeded in finding his brother&rsquo;s address in
Philadelphia. The brother offered him a home
and a chance to work, so it was arranged for our
friend to go to him.</p>

<p>As he was bidding me &ldquo;adieu&rdquo; he said: "When
we first met, you asked me if I had read any
anarchistic writings, and I answered you untruthfully.
I have read the authors you mentioned,
and in my desperation I do not know to what
extreme I might not have gone, for I had lost faith
in all men.</p>

<p>"But to see these young men at the Colony,
forgetful of their own troubles, trying to help me
to a renewal of courage, gave me a clearer viewpoint
of life&mdash;the blood I see now in my dreams
is not that of the capitalist done to death by a
communistic mob&mdash;it is the blood of the gentle
Christ, who said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">&ldquo;It</span> is his diffidence,&rdquo; the
good lady told me, &ldquo;that
has caused the young man
to fail dismally in this
strenuous age of materialism.
His is a gentle spirit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At their first meeting, she
told me, when he called at
her home and asked for
something to eat, he appeared so shy and embarrassed
that she was immediately interested in
him. He blushed and stammered in a most
pitiable way, and after he had eaten heartily of
the roast beef and potatoes placed before him he
wanted to hurry away, hardly having the courage
to remain and thank his benefactor.</p>

<p>The good lady told me all this in such a serious
manner that I felt I must accept it seriously, and
when she suggested that I drive over to a neighboring
village to meet the boy at the train, because,
being unaccustomed to travel, he could
never find his way alone to the Colony, I arranged
to meet him.</p>

<p>There are simple-minded men&mdash;mental defectives&mdash;who
are oftentimes helpless as children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and I was inclined to put this boy in that class.</p>

<p>But the lad whom I found waiting for me at
the station came out to meet me in a manner so
self-possessed that for the instant I was startled.
The report of him seemed to be much in error.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought not to have put you to all this trouble,&rdquo;
he said, in ready apology.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The letter,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;stated that you might
not be able to find your way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave me a sly, shrewd glance, and then,
confident that he was understood, he said simply,
&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally you did not confide in the lady who
sent you, that you had freighted it through most
States as far as the railroads go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I did not approach her as a penitent at
confessional,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but rather as a panhandler
at the side door. Confession may help
to advance a man spiritually, but to a man living
on the material plane, would you advise it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it true,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;that you stammered and
blushed when our friend offered you roast beef
and potatoes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my best canvass,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>We had driven some distance while this conversation
was in progress, and coming to cross-roads,
I was uncertain of the direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go in to that farmhouse, please,&rdquo; I said to my
companion, pointing to a cheerful looking home a
short distance from the road, &ldquo;and inquire the
way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He alighted quickly and went around to the
side door out of my sight. I waited, every
moment expecting him to return with the desired
information, and was growing impatient when
he came out to me, his face beaming with the
enthusiasm that follows a successful interview.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is your share,&rdquo; he said, holding out a
generous portion of hot apple pie to me. &ldquo;The
lady who lives here is a motherly soul&mdash;very
proud of her cooking, and the pie did smell most
tempting&mdash;I could not resist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you use your usual &lsquo;blush and stammer&rsquo;
method to solicit this pastry?&rdquo; I questioned him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she was as hungry for my compliments
as I was for her apple pie, so we simply made a
fair exchange.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the directions back to the Colony?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The direction?&rdquo; and he felt extremely stupid.
&ldquo;I felt all the time that&mdash;in my sub-conscious
mind&mdash;there was a thought trying to assert itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the strength of a bad habit,&rdquo; I remarked,
&ldquo;held back the thought: habit is a strong force
for good or evil, for it perpetuates itself by a form,
as it were, of auto-suggestion. You know all
suggestions are powerful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is good pie, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he asked, irrelevantly.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_y_077.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Years</span> ago, I saw a near-sighted
cook peeling onions&mdash;a
most pathetic scene if
one judges entirely from
appearances. The incident
impressed me deeply at the
time, although it had long
since passed from my mind,
when good old Fritz came
to me, with tears running down the dusty furrows
of his be-wrinkled and weather-beaten face.</p>

<p>Some strange analogy revived the old memory.
There is&mdash;say what one will&mdash;something tremendously
ludicrous about honesty when clothed
too deeply in rusticity. We smile at it while we
give it our love and respect.</p>

<p>It can toy with our heart-strings, playing both
grave and gay. We laugh at it so that we may
not cry and become laughable ourselves.</p>

<p>In broken English, he tried to explain that which
was self-evident and needed no explanation&mdash;his
own distress and desperation. His simple earnestness&mdash;his
frank, honest manner&mdash;won every
one&rsquo;s immediate sympathy. The boys began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
plan to relieve his distress, even while they laughed
with scant courtesy in the old man&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>His clothes were many sizes too large, which
was not entirely offset by his cap that was several
sizes too small. Through his broken shoes, ten
toes spoke in most eloquent English&mdash;the need
of protection and shelter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What could ever cause a man to get into such
a condition?&rdquo; asked a fellow, who, three weeks
before, had arrived quite as dishevelled, but had
already forgotten the fact, which is just as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cause?&rdquo; asked the German.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beer! You are the first man I ever saw who
got to such a finish on beer,&rdquo; returned the questioner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I drink nothing else&mdash;never,&rdquo; the old German
affirmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am thinking Mr. Floyd will try to clean you
up in a hurry&mdash;or not at all&mdash;if you tell him
that beer put you down and out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;I feel pretty
bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Some mighty arguments have been put out
that it is the distilled liquors that do all the mischief;
that light wine and malt liquors are no
more harmful than tea. And here you are in our
camp to disprove this contention. If you say you
have been on a beer debauch, you may not be
believed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe someone put a little apple-jack into my
glass when I wasn&rsquo;t looking,&rdquo; replied the German,
quickly, as he went into the boys&rsquo; kitchen to get
a little coffee.</p>

<p>So it came about that Fritz became a Colony
member, and his good nature made him a general
favorite almost immediately. His strength returned
to him rapidly.</p>

<p>The final cure was effected when, among the
books that came in, one of the men found a German
volume. He took it to Fritz with some misgiving,
as it was a work on astronomy, and Fritz
did not resemble a Heidelberg professor; but when
our friend glanced at the book and saw the German
text, and then, on closer scrutiny, observed that
it was a work on astronomy, he became excitedly
enthusiastic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! Very good! I am happy to get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a week later, an hour or two after midnight,
I saw Fritz in the moonlight, walking
around outside the house.</p>

<p>I went out to question him, as his actions
seemed strange to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the trouble, Fritz?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I would rather not have the men out so
late,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot find it,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Find what, Fritz? What have you lost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot find the North Star,&rdquo; he said, sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know where to look for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; but it is always cloudy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment the clouds began to move&mdash;not
because Fritz wished it, but his patience had
outstayed the clouds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There it is. That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he
ran into the stable, leaving me standing alone
star-gazing to no purpose. But Fritz rejoined
me as abruptly as he had left me. He had
brought out with him a square board with an
iron rod running through it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you there?&rdquo; I questioned him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my sun-dial; it is my own invention. I
have never seen a sun-dial, but I am sure that
mine will be as correct as any of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he fastened the dial firmly on a stump,
pointing the wire straight at the North Star.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the morning I can see if I am right. Good
night, Mr. Floyd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night, Fritz.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For several weeks Fritz worked about the place
timing his labor by his ingenious invention. Sometimes
he would work after the shadows had
passed the quitting hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dial tells us,&rdquo; I said to him one day, &ldquo;that
it is time to stop work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;sun-dials are never exact; sometimes
they vary fifteen minutes, at least. For the
Earth goes around the Sun not in a circle but in
an ellipse. I will work a little longer.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One Sunday I overheard Fritz talking excitedly
out near the spot where the dial was stationed.
I thought he had for the moment forgotten he
was a Self Master&mdash;as all men are likely at times
to forget. But when I went out to check the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
noise, I found that Fritz had ten or fifteen of the
men standing in front of him and he was saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is easy to do&mdash;to measure the distance to
the Sun, or the distance from one planet to another.
There are a hundred methods, many of
them as simple as it is to measure the length of
a building.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a student of astronomy?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, for many years, I have studied the German
books on astronomy. It is my pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From that day our respect for Fritz was established.
There is an aristocracy of learning; we
doff our hats to even the beggar who knows.</p>

<p>The visitors were all interested in Fritz&rsquo;s queer
looking sun-dial, made out of a square board and
piece of telegraph wire. Automobiles halted by
the roadside to look at it. The children insisted
on setting their Ingersolls by its falling shadow.
A well known physician stood examining the dial
one day. He took out his watch to make comparison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very clever,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;very clever; now let
me see Fritz.&rdquo; And Fritz came out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t much to look at,&rdquo; the Doctor whispered
to me, as the old German approached us.</p>

<p>Just then the five o&rsquo;clock whistle blew. The
Doctor and I looked at the dial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The shadow,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;falls on the figure five.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; replied the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must,&rdquo; said Fritz, quietly; &ldquo;it must, for the
wire points to the North Star.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor smiled, as he spoke: &ldquo;A man intelligent
enough to make that dial can, at least,
care for my stable and horses.... Fritz,
would you like to work for me? I have some
splendid horses and I pay well for their care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go gladly,&rdquo; said Fritz; &ldquo;when do you
want me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I go, Mr. Floyd?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On one condition,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must give the Colony your sun-dial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nothing, but you may have it if you
like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day Fritz was given a good suit of
clothes, a collar and tie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about the collar and tie,&rdquo; said
the old man; &ldquo;I have not worn one for many
months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three or four of the boys helped him to button
on the collar and arrange the ascot effectively.
Then the Doctor came with his best span of pet
horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jump in with me, Fritz,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The old German, smiling, climbed in and then
turned, took his hat off to me and the boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you.... Good luck,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take the reins and drive,&rdquo; said the Doctor.</p>

<p>Fritz buttoned his coat tightly around him,
straightened up his old bent back and taking the
reins he proudly drove away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did not come in a carriage,&rdquo; said a boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the Self Masters that helped him,&rdquo; said
another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget about the Sun-dial,&rdquo; I said.</p>

faithfully, it was the
time for the auto party to
have finished their tea and

their machine, but there
seemed to be a delay somewhere.
Investigation revealed
a peculiar condition of affairs. The visitors
were moving about rather impatiently while the
lunch, instead of being served, was rapidly getting
chilled on the side-board in an adjoining
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Delmonico Bill, the attentive waiter,&rdquo;
we asked, not a little surprised at his disappearance.
He was nowhere to be found, although we
hunted high and low for him.</p>

<p>But to manage men successfully who admit
their irresponsibility needs an overseer who is
not only patient in disappointment, but who can
offer the pat excuse impromptu, and cheerfully
reassure friends that everything is all right, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>&mdash;unless
viewed from the standpoint of a year
from to-day&mdash;it is all wrong.</p>

<p>On this special day there seemed to be no apparent
explanation except that the waiter did not
wait. But everything is a success that ends
happily, and the delayed lunch made the visitors
more than ever in sympathy with the Work.
Whoever loves us for our mistakes, shall become
more endeared to us as they know us better.
The diners&mdash;who had not dined&mdash;saw humor
in our embarrassment, and assured us of their
best wishes as they drove merrily away, leaving
us stupidly asking ourselves why the waiter had
left his guests unserved.</p>

<p>It was nearly an hour later when Delmonico
Bill came down out of the hay loft, brushing the
dust and hay-seed from his clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has she gone?&rdquo; he enquired stupidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; we asked him in chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Sunday school teacher,&rdquo; he explained.</p>

<p>We awaited his further explanation. It was
the first time we had heard that he ever had
such a teacher.</p>

<p>"It isn&rsquo;t that I am in the least ashamed to serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
as a waiter. Menial work that must be done is
not humiliating to me. But when I looked in at
the visitors as I was arranging their lunch on the
tray&mdash;I recognized in one of the ladies my old
Sunday school teacher&mdash;and when I thought to
what an extent I had disregarded her instructions
I hadn&rsquo;t the courage to face her.... My, but it
was hot up in that haymow!...</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last time I saw this good lady was the
evening in the church vestry when the class
members gave her a group picture of themselves.
We all went to the local photographers together.
There were three rows of us&mdash;the tall, taller and
tallest&mdash;all raw-boned rascals trying to assume
the spiritual pose of Sir Galahad. I never cared
much for the photograph, but the frame&mdash;the
gold frame&mdash;much befiligreed was mighty impressive.
I remember it because there was
seventy-five cents of my money in it. I worked
hard for that money. It took me the best part
of three nights to get it from Cy Watson&mdash;playing
penny-ante in his father&rsquo;s carriage house.
But I was happy to turn it to such good use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was tainted money,&rdquo; said one of the boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"There wasn&rsquo;t any such thing as tainted
money in those days. Money was money and
no one had any of it.</p>

<p>"I made the presentation speech that night in
the vestry. It was a masterpiece. The teacher
and the women folks all cried. I have forgotten
the speech now; thirty years of knocking around
the world crowds out the memory of many
things that happened when we were boys in
Sunday school. But for years, I could repeat
that piece. I rehearsed for that evening over two
months&mdash;I could say it forwards or backwards,
I could start it in the middle and say it both
ways&mdash;in fact when I think of it, I rather believe
that was the way I did say it that evening,
because the applause that followed my humble
effort was too tempestuous, yet the scholars all
had their money in the gold frame, and the
teacher was to leave us next morning for the
East, where she was to marry some man of
prominence. My mother said I spoke splendidly,
but I doubt if she really heard me. She was
thinking how charming I looked in the new
trousers she had made for me. The truth was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
she had worked all the night before to get them
ready. She had had some difficulty to make the
seams come down the side. As it was they were
not quite finished, but no one knew it but my
mother and me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the years that are to come,&rdquo; I said in my
speech, &ldquo;not only will your kindly instructions in
our Bible studies help us to meet and overcome
all temptation, but the inspiration which we have
received from your friendship and devotion to
our spiritual welfare will influence us throughout
our lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the moment Delmonico Bill was silent&mdash;whatever
his thoughts may have been, he did
not share them with us. But presently, he observed
the tray with the tea and toast upon it,
just as he had left it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too bad,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;maybe she would not
have known me at all.... I am sorry ... but
you can understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he began to clear away the lunch. &ldquo;The
tea is still warm,&rdquo; he said smilingly, &ldquo;I believe I
will pour a cup for myself ... my nerves are
jumping, it may quiet them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>He filled the cup and raising it he said: &ldquo;Here
is to my Sunday school teacher who believed in
me in those days when I believed in myself.
God bless her.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> was a knock at the
door, but no one thought
of answering it until it was
repeated&mdash;more faintly, a
second time&mdash;then one of
the young men opened it,
saying to the newcomer,
&ldquo;It is never locked, my
boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In stepped a lad some seventeen years of age,
and inquired in a voice hardly audible if he could
stay all night.</p>

<p>The young men sent the new arrival to me for
an answer to his request. It was readily to be
seen that the boy was in a state of great excitement.
He acted so strangely that, contrary to
custom, I asked him why he had come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The police are after me,&rdquo; he stammered, as
he turned and looked nervously at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; I questioned the boy.</p>

<p>"I stole a bicycle and the owner just saw me
walking along the street and started to chase me,
calling after me, &lsquo;Stop, thief!&rsquo; A crowd began
to gather and I had all I could do to get away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
I ran around a building and joined the crowd in
the search; then, after a little, I dropped out of
sight again and decided that I would go out to
you for advice."</p>

<p>"Where is the bicycle now?" I questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sold it,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the money you got for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I spent it.&rdquo; He began to cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now your conscience starts to trouble
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lad,&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;this is no hiding place
for boys who steal, and for whom the police are
searching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy did not reply; he turned aside and
brushed away the tears with his cap. Then he
started slowly towards the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I can&rsquo;t stay?&rdquo; he said finally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid not,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>He went to the window and peered out into
the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll get me,&rdquo; he said, hopelessly, &ldquo;and
when they do it means a long term in prison for
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Have you been
arrested before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, another boy and myself took some fancy
postal cards from a stationery stand. They were
funny pictures that we wanted for our collection.
We were sent to Jamesburg that time. Then
since I came from that institution I was arrested
again for something else I did and I am now out
on probation. Next time the judge said he would
give me a long sentence in the Rahway Reformatory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have thought of all this sooner,&rdquo;
I said, with a sternness that I did not feel, for I
knew how easily one can drift from an evil
thought into an evil act.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard you helped boys when they needed
it,&rdquo; ventured the young rascal. &ldquo;I surely need
it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may help them when I can,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but
I never intentionally make myself a partner in
their wrong doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The judge ought not to give me more than
three years,&rdquo; said the boy thoughtfully, "even
that is a long time.... The bicycle wasn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
worth more than five dollars any way. The
owner said he would sell it to me for that
amount."</p>

<p>At that moment there was a noise in the next
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; asked the lad, trembling
with fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your conscience is quite wakeful, my boy.
That was one of the men closing the windows
for the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy came over close to me so he could
look into my face, and there was a depth of seriousness
in his voice when he said, &ldquo;So you think
I ought to give myself up and take the consequences?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three years in prison?&rdquo; I asked, looking
straight at the boy. &ldquo;Three years in prison!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words of Jacob Riis flashed through my
mind&mdash;&ldquo;When a boy goes to prison, a citizen dies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you were in my place you would give
yourself up?&rdquo; he asked me pointedly.</p>

<p>I passed my hand across my eyes. Unlike the
boy I had no cap with which to brush away the
tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I will be honest with you&mdash;I
would not give myself up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, I would make up my mind not to steal
any more, then I would earn money and pay
the man for the bicycle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A new light came into the boy&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not used to be a thief,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
they made me mad. Ever since I came from
Jamesburg every one watches me. My old boy
friends, my father and mother, the police; someone&rsquo;s
eye is always on me. Their suspicions
madden me. Sometimes it seems to me as if
they dared me to take another risk. One day on
the ferryboat from New York I met a detective
who had once arrested me. Wherever I went
he followed me. I was afraid, so I left the other
boys who were with me and went to the stern
of the boat. I didn&rsquo;t tell anyone, but when I was
all alone I put my hands down into my own
pockets so he would know that I didn&rsquo;t have
them in anyone else&rsquo;s.... I&rsquo;m not very old,
but I know that that isn&rsquo;t the way to make a bad
boy into a good one.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>After a moment I said to him: &ldquo;if I can arrange
with the owner of the bicycle so that you
can pay for it in small weekly payments, will
you join the Colony and out of the little money
you earn settle with the man you have wronged?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will help me,&rdquo; returned the lad hopefully,
&ldquo;I will make good to the man and to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning I talked the boy&rsquo;s case over
with an elderly attorney who lives with us, and
who knows of his own knowledge the ruin one
can bring upon himself if he does not follow
proper methods. The old man gladly undertook
to settle with the owner of the stolen bicycle,
and save the boy from the consequences of his
wrongdoing.</p>

<p>The boy worked industriously about the place
and in a few weeks had earned sufficient money
to settle satisfactorily for the bicycle. He is now
working on a neighbor&rsquo;s farm and says that he
is determined to make something worth while
out of his life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said the old attorney to me
recently, "if anyone ever charges us with having
compounded a felony in the case of this boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and his bicycle we can defend ourselves on the
technical ground that the bicycle was of such
slight value that the stealing of it was only a
petty crime."</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this case&mdash;the saving of a boy from
prison&rdquo;&mdash;I answered him, &ldquo;if a technicality saves
us from a criminal charge which might be brought
against us, I for one am perfectly satisfied with
such a defense.&rdquo;</p>

&mdash;<cite>George Cohan&rsquo;s Song, &ldquo;Sullivan.&rdquo;</cite><br />
</p>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i_107.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">If</span> you thought it was imperative
to change your
name and you had access
to all the Literature&mdash;Ancient
and Modern&mdash;to
be found in a Carnegie
Library, would you select
for yourself the name
&ldquo;Sullivan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evidently our Irish Lad agreed with Cohan&mdash;that
&ldquo;it is a d&mdash;n fine name&rdquo;&mdash;for when I recognized
in him one of my Family of Homeless
Men as he walked aimlessly along the city streets,
and asked him rather abruptly, what his name
might be, his reply&mdash;too long considered to be
truthful&mdash;was, &ldquo;Frank Sullivan.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; I said, immediately realizing
that I had no right to ask of him the question and
that my thoughtlessness had caused the boy to
answer falsely. The outcast, distrustful of his
fellow, frequently seeks safety in falsehood until
friendship disarms suspicion and Love calls forth
the Truth for which it has not asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Frank Sullivan</em>,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I, too, like the
name.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So upon my invitation he came gladly into our
little Family to share the happy freedom of a
peaceful home, where others like himself give
honest work and receive&mdash;not in the spirit of
organized charity, but in the true warmth of
fraternal love&mdash;the hospitality of a welcome
guest.</p>

<p>His Irish heart soon caught the meaning of the
work, and responded readily in thoughtful service....
If our Self Master Colony attracted the
attention of some broad-minded man well known
in humanitarian work so that encouraged, it carried
me and my dreams of uplift higher and
higher until the stars were our near neighbors&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>Sullivan,
silent and attentive, followed me in my
dreams.</p>

<p>If my work was misunderstood and my best
efforts discredited, Sullivan was at my side silently
consoling me with his loyalty and friendship.</p>

<p>He grew into my life. I depended upon him
and he did not fail me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Richelieu,&rdquo; I would often say, &ldquo;had his Friar
Philip to aid him in his ambitions and I have my
good friend Sullivan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then as the months passed, once again, the
grass spread its delicate carpet beneath our feet,
the trees blossomed sending a perfumed message
to us, the bluebird and the thrush called through
the open windows until we, busy with our work,
were forced to remark that Spring time had come&mdash;the
beginning of another year....
Then the Brothers observed the progress we had
made in the twelvemonth.... It seemed so
much to them, so little to the outside world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks more prosperous now,&rdquo; said Sullivan
proudly as he observed the automobiles stopping
at the door, &ldquo;you make Prince as well as Pauper
do you homage.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sullivan, not I; it&rsquo;s the Truth that all are
hungry for&mdash;Pauper and Prince alike&mdash;and while
the few may reach it by meditation and the more
by prayer, the most of common clay like you and
I must reach it by service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never quite understand you when you
speak,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I never could read those dry
old books however much I tried.... But
by the way, I wonder if we have blankets for the
new arrival who just came in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the Stranded Sons of the City come often
to join our Family and share our simple hospitality.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&ldquo;Sullivan,&rdquo; I said one day, &ldquo;this work is going
to grow and grow.... When we have won
I want you to share the credit with me&mdash;you
will remain, will you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then receiving no reply, I turned to look and
he had gone&mdash;gone to offer his blanket to the new
guest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I heard him say, &ldquo;I have some extra
covers on my bed you may have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>"Another falsehood. Sullivan, you should al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>ways
speak the truth." For the nights were cold
and the blankets none too many. And yet since
many prayers are lies, why may not some lies
be prayers? &ldquo;Maybe in your dark purgatory,
my Irish lad, these little falsehoods of yours will
be counted as prayers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One afternoon a letter came for my friend&mdash;in
a young girl&rsquo;s rather labored writing&mdash;he had
received many such, and as I gave it to him I
smiled a little. To him I had always been an indulgent
Father&mdash;for a boy and girl will love, even
though he or she may be our favorite child.</p>

<p>That night when the day&rsquo;s labor was over,
Sullivan came to me, asking if he could talk to
me. It was a strange request, for he never seemed
to wish to talk, and I knew that something had
moved him deeply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know my name is not Frank Sullivan,&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; I answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But did you know I was married?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, a boy like yourself married?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have been married over two years and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
have a little girl a year old. The letters that I
have received have been from my wife Josephine.
She and I ran away and were married, but on
our return her father wouldn&rsquo;t accept me. He
said I was not worthy of his daughter&mdash;and no
doubt he is right. He is wealthy and I could not
support her in the way to which she is accustomed.
So I was forced to leave her. But Josephine
and I couldn&rsquo;t forget.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All these months she has been working to
interest her father in me, and now the baby is a
year old, he has decided to help me.... We&mdash;Josephine
and I&mdash;knew he would soften in time;
you see he, too, loves Josephine and the Baby.
So I want to go to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said simply, for a sense of approaching
loss had robbed me of my pretty speeches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you met me, I didn&rsquo;t know where to
go, nor what to do,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have flattered myself I have been some help
to you in starting your work. Tell me have I
made good to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall try to make good to Josephine&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then in a few moments he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that it is time to go from you, I hate to
leave you and the boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you must go,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;your wife and
child have the first claim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Josephine wanted me to ask you for two or
three rugs that the boys weave. We want them
for our new home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may have them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I took him by the hand, &ldquo;Good-by, Sullivan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not Sullivan anymore, but McLean,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>As he turned away he said half regretfully, &ldquo;It
is the Passing of Sullivan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Richelieu, after all, lost his Friar
Philip?&rdquo; I asked myself as I waved my hand in
farewell to him.</p>

few broken umbrellas and a railroad spike for a
hammer, starts out with the Springtime on the
quest of &ldquo;anything to mend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Umbrella mending was once a reputable calling,
but it has fallen into disrepute since the introduction
of the cheap umbrella. But that pathetic
part of the story should be left for Lakewood Joe
to tell, for it gets him&mdash;a humble mechanic&mdash;many
a hot cup of coffee, many a dime.</p>

<p>The recommendation by my two friends was
sufficiently strong to nearly cause me to refuse
admission to young Jim. But his manner pleased
me and our reception committee&mdash;made up of
members of the Family&mdash;assured me that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
had no need to fear poor Jim. Anyway he who
has nothing can safely make friends with whomever
he chooses.</p>

<p>Jim told us that years ago he had been a
&ldquo;cookie&rdquo;&mdash;please note the &ldquo;ie&rdquo;&mdash;in a lumber
camp in an Eastern State. So when a vacancy
occurred in the culinary department of our home
Jim was selected for the place.</p>

<p>He proved an excellent assistant and worked
for the house&mdash;as the phrase goes&mdash;he made the
coffee so weak, he made the potato soup go so
far, that I, economical from habit and from necessity,
would blush whenever one of the boys said
that he enjoyed the good dinner.</p>

<p>I need have had no fear for it was Jim&rsquo;s smile
that made us all content with the simple fare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A grand cook,&rdquo; the boys would say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A grand cook,&rdquo; Echo and I would answer.</p>

<p>Jim had roughed it for several years and knew
a little of the ways of the road. He had worked
when a boy in his father&rsquo;s factory and as some
of the workmen felt they were not being paid
properly&mdash;the son joined in with the workmen
and went out on a strike against his father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>In the excitement of the strike the father had
spoken to the son about his joining in with the
strikers. It seemed to the father like disloyalty&mdash;ingratitude.
But as for the son, he couldn&rsquo;t
analyze his own psychological state of mind sufficiently
to explain why his sympathy had been
with the strikers, but feeling himself no longer
welcome at the old home, he started to roam.</p>

<p>Seven years had passed since he had written
to the old folks. Once or twice he had heard indirectly
of his father&rsquo;s search for him, but he
could not even bring himself to write, much less
to return.</p>

<p>He had been with us nearly a month when
finally, one evening, as he saw the other boys
writing letters to their homes he decided he himself
would write a letter to his married sister in
Pennsylvania. When it was written and mailed,
he half regretted what he had done.</p>

<p>Wasn&rsquo;t he a wanderer&mdash;a young hobo if you
like&mdash;and why should he think of home after all
these years, even if the kindly sympathy to be
found at the Colony did recall to him those better
days?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>But the letter was already on its way....
He wondered what his sister might think, how
she might act.... She had always cared for
him.</p>

<p>The bean soup which he was preparing for
supper burned while he was deep in thought,
and he blamed himself for his absent-mindedness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boys will have to eat burnt soup just
because I got to feeling sentimental,&rdquo; he said to
himself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then a word came that a nicely gowned young
lady was coming up the driveway. There are
many visitors at the Tea Room of the Colony
House so it need have caused no excitement.
But some one whispered &ldquo;Look at Jim!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had glanced out at the approaching stranger,
and he was pale and trembling. He said to
me in a faint voice, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my sister. Tell her I
left this morning.... Tell her I got a position.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then the bell rang and he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait&mdash;I will see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So brushing his hair and arranging his tie he
went in to meet his sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The homeless outcast lad faced his aristocratic
sweet-faced sister! As the boys saw them they
did not know which one to pity the more, although
the sympathy seemed to be pretty largely
with Jim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is every one well?&rdquo; the brother asked, trying
to relieve the strain of the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, "but why have you
never written all these years? I got your letter
this morning and left in an hour to get to you for
fear I might lose you again. Father has hunted
for you everywhere. He thinks he was harsh
with you when you struck that day with the
men&mdash;for you were only a child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I might get you to come home
with me,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;my husband and I
have a splendid home. You are always welcome....
Or why don&rsquo;t you go back to your old
job with Father. He needs you. He is getting
older.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think he would take me back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gladly. What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am cook for the boys,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, a cook?&rdquo; she smiled. "Why, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
wouldn&rsquo;t wash a dish at home for me when we
were children. You can&rsquo;t be very much of a
cook.... But never mind. I have found
you."</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound it! I have let those beans burn
again.&rdquo; And he excused himself for a moment.</p>

<p>When he returned he said, &ldquo;I will write you
if I can decide to go back home. It comes a little
suddenly you know. I have been a prodigal
too long to turn into a father&rsquo;s white-haired boy
on the instant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then after a moment he asked: &ldquo;Do you know
what Mother used to put into the beans when
she burned them to take out the smoky taste?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim, Mother wasn&rsquo;t that kind of a cook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the sister was going out to step into the
carriage she said, &ldquo;Promise me you will not
leave here without writing me. I don&rsquo;t want to
lose you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night the boys ate their supper in silence.
Each one was deep in thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too bad the beans are burned,&rdquo; Jim said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I like them that way,&rdquo; replied one of the
boys. &ldquo;It makes them taste different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night after supper no one wrote any letters,
which was unusual, and one of the boys
jokingly asked another near him, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
you write a letter home to your sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; replied the lad, &ldquo;she might answer
it in person like Jim&rsquo;s sister did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim has taken a job on a farm and is saving his
money. He has nearly enough to return to his
old home; he refuses to accept any aid from his
father or sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go back as I came away&mdash;independently.&rdquo;</p>

but to be dull
of wit and be compelled to
live in a Colony made up
of more or less reckless
young men is doubly unfortunate.</p>

<p>In the group eccentricities
are quickly discouraged.
The grouch, the crank, the bully, if he
would remain and live in harmony must learn
his lesson in democracy&mdash;the individualist is

at all times, and in theory he is, but in
real practice even the most gentle hearted man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
will have his little joke at the expense of the man
less alert mentally. The members of the Colony
are no exception to this rule.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us more,&rdquo; the boys asked of the Moon-Struck-One,
one evening after the day&rsquo;s work
was done, &ldquo;about the inhabitants of Mars, which
you see in your trances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then he&mdash;the Moon-Struck-One&mdash;would
explain in detail the strange people he had seen
in his dreams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These planets,&rdquo; he told them, &ldquo;are all being
made ready for the coming race of Man....
After Cycles and Cycles, we move on to newer
and better worlds.... Each of the mystic
Seven Planets are at the service of the human
race. Time and time again a new world has
borne the burden of the evolving man&rsquo;s hope and
his despair.... The cosmic scheme is worthy
of the Wondrous God, who holds not only the
Seven Planets in control, but rules the Seven
Universes with their Seven Suns&mdash;you laugh,
most men laugh, the churchmen laugh, they do
not know, they have not seen&mdash;but I know and
have seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How interesting,&rdquo; said one boy, winking slyly
to his fellows. &ldquo;I know something of astronomy
myself; my brother was a Princeton graduate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a summer&rsquo;s evening when this conversation
took place and the boys were sitting out
on the lawn enjoying the night air, for the day
had been hot and oppressive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do any of you know of the Stars?&rdquo;
said the Moon-Struck-Sage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very little, but tell us,&rdquo; said one of the boys,
&ldquo;for I believe in your visions. I dreamed one
night myself about a big fire&mdash;a bad sign as you
very well know&mdash;and the next day I got &lsquo;pinched.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are deeply learned in the Stars,&rdquo; he
said with smiling skepticism, &ldquo;that is, I suppose
you can tell the difference between a star and a
lantern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out,&rdquo; said a boy who had not spoken
before, &ldquo;he is joking you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, seriously,&rdquo; said the Witless One, "when
I said &lsquo;lantern&rsquo; I had reference to the light that
Edison hangs out each night when the weather
is clear&mdash;you have no doubt read of it. He plans
to construct a light that will illuminate this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
country at night almost as brightly as the sun
lights it by day.... Do you see that light
just above the trees in the East. You can tell it
as it is larger than any stars around it. It has the
appearance of a star only much brighter. Do
you see it?"</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boys who were all attention,
although one or two were skeptical until one of
the group remembered that he had read about
Edison&rsquo;s powerful light in the Sunday magazine
supplement of a New York paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a wonderful man,&rdquo; said another.</p>

<p>At last all were convinced and the Moon-Struck-One,
satisfied, arose rather abruptly, and
went into the house.</p>

<p>A few days later he left the Colony to go to
his relatives in a distant city, and so the boys
had no one to play tricks upon, no one who was
not their equal in wit.</p>

<p>It was some weeks afterwards that one of the
young men said to me as we were talking out of
doors in the evening:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is that light of Edison&rsquo;s hanging over
the trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That bright light over there that looks like a
big star. The Witless One told us about it. In
some ways he was really wiser than we gave
him credit for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Evening Star,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is what?&rdquo; asked another boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Venus, the Evening Star.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He told us it was put up there by Edison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it really isn&rsquo;t an illuminated balloon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys looked from one to the other, then
every one laughed loudly and long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t the Bible say, &lsquo;Answer a fool according
to his folly?&rsquo;&rdquo; asked a boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it also says, &lsquo;Answer not a fool according
to his folly, lest thou also be like unto
him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

in the early days of Spring&mdash;the
so-called hobo takes
to the open road, the millionaire
to his country
home, each rejoices that
the long imprisonment of
winter is passed, for all
men are akin in their love of freedom. It is a
search for the ideal. With De Soto we would
say, &ldquo;Somewhere, if ye seek untiringly, ye shall
discover and drinke of ye Fountaine of Youth and
Happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men have said they do not understand my
restless wanderings,&rdquo; remarked Lakewood Tom.
"Can it be they have never watched the coming
of the first robin, and do not know that he ushers
in the new regime of promise and prosperity?</p>

<p>"Other men may linger in the failing twilight of
the tired day. I go to greet the rising sun. Even
the very birds&mdash;little hoboes of the air, break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
camp cheerfully in early May. Like them I, too,
take to the open road and walk by faith.</p>

<p>"But you, my lords, with your worldly goods,
are vagabonds no less than I. Out of the inexhaustible
larder of the Divine, God gives you&mdash;as
it were&mdash;a crust of bread, and men call you mighty
in riches. Take a vagabond&rsquo;s advice, and put your
mark upon the house where you found favor, lest
after many years, disheartened, you pass that way
again and need another &lsquo;handout&rsquo;&mdash;maybe not a
crust of bread, but, a more lasting gift&mdash;an ideal
perchance, that may not fail so soon. Sometimes
methinks it sad, there is given to man only the
thing for which he asks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adieu,&rdquo; said Lakewood Tom, taking up his
staff, &ldquo;when the snow falls next year I may visit
your Monastery again with your permission, if by
happy chance I am on this earth. If not, I&rsquo;ll meet
you some Christmas day on the planet Mars, for
I never forget a friend. Good cheer! Adieu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much privation has crazed the old man,&rdquo; said

walking slowly down the drive.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">&ldquo;It</span> is always hard times on
the Bowery,&rdquo; my diminutive
informant told me.
He was a new comer to
our Colony. He, in company
with another young
man, had made his appearance
an hour or two before,
but I had not been able to
talk with him, except to assure him that he and
his friend might remain with us one night, at
least. &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;without money
a man is a dead one; even in this strange haunt of
stranger men money is a daily need. Of course,
some men who know the hidden ways can get
along on as little as twenty cents a day, or less,
but for myself I could not exist on less than
thirty-five cents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The figures he mentioned seemed modest
enough to me. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you earn that much?&rdquo;
I asked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so small no one would hire me,&rdquo; he replied.
"I could get errands to do now and then.
Of course, while my mother lived she kept a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
home for me, but after she died I did not know
what to do. I only sat in the house day after
day and looked out of the window. I could not
make any plans for myself. You see when I was
a baby I fell and injured my back. I didn&rsquo;t grow
much more after that accident. The doctors called
it a curvature."</p>

<p>He laughed easily as he asked me, "You know
the poem of James Whitcomb Riley,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m th&rsquo;ust a little cripple boy</div>

    <div class="verse">An&rsquo; git a great big man at all,</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">&lsquo;Cause auntie told me so.&rsquo;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;I rather think I&rsquo;m that boy. One time I
chanced to find that poem and read it to my
mother. She took the book from me in the gentle
way she had, and then putting her arms around
me, told me to be a good boy and everything
would come out all right. But they never did
come all right. Maybe I was not good enough;
but this can&rsquo;t interest you. You hear enough hard
luck stories without mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wish to tell me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I shall be
quite glad to listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s only this,&rdquo; he continued. "Left to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
myself, I wasn&rsquo;t smart enough to make a living.
I can&rsquo;t get my room rent and my lunch money
all at the same time. If I have my lunches I have no
room, and if I have a room I have nothing to eat."</p>

<p>He grew very serious. He could laugh at his
misshapen back, make a jest at his deformity, but
hunger&mdash;even at the thought of hunger&mdash;the
smile left his face, the color fled from his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you faint?&rdquo; I asked him quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am a coward,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just a plain
coward. You see, I am beaten and I know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be all right in a few days,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;and be able to criticise the food as cheerfully as
any other member of my Family.&rdquo; I laughed
gayly enough, but he did not laugh with me.
&ldquo;Have you and this boy been friends a long
time? Where did you meet him?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the park, some weeks ago. He has no
home either. He was sleeping out and so was I.
He gave me part of a newspaper to put under
me, as the ground was damp. So I tried to talk
to him.... He is good looking, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I admitted it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s a Russian dummy,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He is what?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He just landed from Russia three months
ago, and he knows very little about the English
language. He doesn&rsquo;t have the slightest idea
what I have been talking to you about all this
time. Night after night, not having any bed to
sleep in, he has &lsquo;flopped&rsquo; in the park or &lsquo;carried
the banner&rsquo; until morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you brought him out with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I didn&rsquo;t know whether you would take
us in or not. I thought I would take him along
on the theory that the ground in Jersey is no
harder to sleep on than it is in New York State.
If you have to turn us away we will not be any
worse off than we have been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will make room somehow for you and
your friend,&rdquo; I told him.</p>

<p>So Jean&mdash;Little Jean, the boys called him&mdash;went
through a pantomime for the enlightenment
of the Russian youth whose name was also Jean.
Finally the larger boy understood that I had
given them permission to remain, for he turned
to me and said simply: &ldquo;Nice,&rdquo; and then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
bowed gracefully. Little Jean was right&mdash;Big
Jean was good looking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I was big and strong like him,&rdquo; said
Little Jean, admiringly....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>... The weeks pass quickly when one has
his work to do, and the two Jeans grew to know
the Colony. Big Jean spent his spare hours
studying English and talking with the other boys.
Little Jean made friends with the chickens, the
pigs, the cow and the horse, while Boozer&mdash;the
Colony dog&mdash;and he were inseparable chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boozer,&rdquo; Little Jean told me, &ldquo;knows the heart
of outcast boys and men. He meets the new
arrivals at the gate and escorts them to the
house. He may challenge the lawless approach
of the rich man in his auto, and warn the household
of possible danger impending, but the most
unkempt &lsquo;knight of the road&rsquo; will find Boozer
quick to make friends with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Big Jean&mdash;with his pleasing bow&mdash;looked after
the guests who visited the Tea Room, for he
learned to speak English rapidly. The report of
his courteous service came to the ears of a wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
awake Jap who needed him to help him in his
hotel. So one day he sent for the Russian lad.</p>

<p>At the start the pay was to be twenty dollars
a month, with room, board and extra tips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need me in your Tea Room, Mr. Floyd,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;I am willing to stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Jean, you must take the position and
prove to me and to yourself that you can make
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night he wrote to his aged mother in
Russia that there were wonderful opportunities
for young men in America.</p>

<p>When he had gone I hunted to find Little Jean.
I found him out on the lawn with his chum,
Boozer. He did not see me as I approached, but
as I looked at him the thought came to me that
he had suddenly grown old, and there was the
anxious look upon his face&mdash;the same that I had
seen when he had talked to me the first time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boozer,&rdquo; I heard him say, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all right; I
am a coward, I&rsquo;m beaten and I know it, but I&rsquo;m
glad Big Jean got the job&mdash;honestly, Boozer, I
am&mdash;you see it isn&rsquo;t all my fault&mdash;he&rsquo;s so damned
good looking.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Boozer put his face close to that of Little Jean
and held out his paw to the discouraged boy.
You see when you live your life at the Self Masters
you sense the inner thought of broken men.
Boozer&mdash;who knows no other life&mdash;understands
the heart of the discouraged. I did not interrupt
the two friends, but turned back to the house.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&ldquo;What can you ever do to help poor Little
Jean?&rdquo; a visitor asked me. &ldquo;There seems to be
no position in the world for him. What can you
do for him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see much chance,&rdquo; I replied, distrusting
for the moment that Divine Guidance that
never fails.</p>

<p>It was only two days after Big Jean had left us
that a kindly old lady called at the Colony. She
wanted a boy who would take good care of her
horses, and drive her and her husband back and
forth from her home to the railway station. &ldquo;I
want a boy who loves animals,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>So Little Jean has his place in the world&mdash;like
you and I if we can only find it....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>... Xmas Day Big Jean brought four big pies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
which he had cooked especially for the Self Masters&rsquo;
dinner.</p>

<p>And Little Jean brought his Xmas present&mdash;all
neatly tied up in a box bedecked with pink ribbons&mdash;a
pound of meat for Boozer.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
